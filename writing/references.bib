	abstract = {In this paper, we provide a framework based upon diffusion processes for finding meaningful geometric descriptions of data sets. We show that eigenfunctions of Markov matrices can be used to construct coordinates called diffusion maps that generate efficient representations of complex geometric structures. The associated family of diffusion distances, obtained by iterating the Markov matrix, defines multiscale geometries that prove to be useful in the context of data parametrization and dimensionality reduction. The proposed framework relates the spectral properties of Markov processes to their geometric counterparts and it unifies ideas arising in a variety of contexts such as machine learning, spectral graph theory and eigenmap methods.}

	abstract = {Biomolecules undergo conformational changes to perform their function. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) can capture snapshots of biomolecules in various conformations. However, these images are noisy and display the molecule in unknown orientations, making it difficult to separate conformational differences from differences due to noise or projection directions. Here, we introduce cryo-EM simulation-based inference (cryoSBI) to infer the conformations of biomolecules and the uncertainties associated with the inference from individual cryo-EM images. CryoSBI builds on simulation-based inference, a combination of physics-based simulations and probabilistic deep learning, allowing us to use Bayesian inference even when likelihoods are too expensive to calculate. We begin with an ensemble of conformations, which can be templates from molecular simulations or modelling, and use them as structural hypotheses. We train a neural network approximating the Bayesian posterior using simulated images from these templates, and then use it to accurately infer the conformations of biomolecules from experimental images. Training is only done once, and after that, it takes just a few milliseconds to evaluate on an image, making cryoSBI suitable for arbitrarily large datasets. This method eliminates the need to estimate particle pose and imaging parameters, significantly enhancing the computational speed in comparison to explicit likelihood methods. We illustrate and benchmark cryoSBI on synthetic data and showcase its promise on experimental single-particle cryo-EM data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {We study the correlation exponent v introduced recently as a characteristic measure of strange attractors which allows one to distinguish between deterministic chaos and random noise. The exponent v is closely related to the fractal dimension and the information dimension, but its computation is considerably easier. Its usefulness in characterizing experimental data which stem from very high dimensional systems is stressed. Algorithms for extracting v from the time series of a single variable are proposed. The relations between the various measures of strange attractors and between them and the Lyapunov exponents are discussed. It is shown that the conjecture of Kaplan and Yorke for the dimension gives an upper bound for v. Various examples of finite and infinite dimensional systems are treated, both numerically and analytically.}
